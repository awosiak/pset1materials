# pset1materials
This github repo has the materials for Problem set 1, due on March 7th by midnight. You will find the following:
1- mimic.csv and lbw.csv. These codebooks explain the variables in the two datasets that you will be using for this problem set.  
2-To access the preprocessed MIMIC datasets required for section 1 (adult_icu.gz, n_icu.gz and adult_notes.gz)  simply log on to your PhysioNet account (https://physionet.org/pnw/login). You should find a project titled MLHC17PS1 which houses those three datasets.  
3 -singletons.gz & twins.gz : The datasets required for section 2 of this problem set 
4 - mimic_icu_cleanup.py and lbw_cleanup.py: you will not use these directly in your problem set. These are the code files used to clean the datasets that we've given you. It is always important and interesting to look at how the data was cleaned up!
